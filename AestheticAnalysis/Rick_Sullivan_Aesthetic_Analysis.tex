%	intro
Designing web pages is a notoriously arduous process. Web frameworks and website building products that aim to solve the difficulties of web page design have become much more prolific and successful in recent years. I will be analyzing the design of the Bootstrap framework, one of the original web frameworks, which completely changed the way websites are designed and constructed.

%	Functionality and design

The Bootstrap web framework provides a library of user interface elements that users can use to quickly build a simple, but functional website. I will separate my analysis of the design of the framework by first looking at the visual design of the UI elements, and then taking a look at how the framework is designed from a usability standpoint.

Because Bootstrap provides user interface components, we can first analyze the aesthetics of the components that it offers. You will likely recognized Bootstrap elements from a large number of websites; Bootstrap has become a ubiquitous standard across the Web. In Figure 1, we can see the Bootstrap buttons, which are extremely simple, yet are adaptable and provide a consistent aesthetic across every website.

The Bootstrap aesthetic extends to its formatting system. Bootstrap divides the page into 12 columns, and web developers can specify their content to be spread across any number of those columns.
